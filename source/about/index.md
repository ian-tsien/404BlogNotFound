Hi, I’m Ian Tsien — a software developer from China with a deep interest in the intersection of computer science and quantitative finance.

I graduated with a degree in Telecommunications Engineering and worked at [Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei) for three years. During my time there, I developed [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) systems and later contributed to a cloud-native resource scheduling platform similar to [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes). This experience sharpened my engineering skills, particularly in large-scale system design and low-level infrastructure development. However, I also began to recognize the importance of work-life balance and the need to reflect on my long-term career direction.

After careful thought, I decided to take a career break. While unconventional—especially in the Chinese job market—this gap has been one of the most transformative periods in my life. I traveled across Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, experiencing diverse cultures and alternative ways of living. These journeys broadened my perspective and inspired me to pursue a more intentional and sustainable life path.

During this time, I also began cultivating new habits. I learned piano to train patience and discipline, and I took up distance running to strengthen both mind and body. At the same time, I dove deep into computer science fundamentals—focusing on systems, networking, databases, and algorithms—while preparing rigorously for technical interviews.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to transition into roles that combine my engineering background with analytical thinking, such as quantitative development. I’m currently expanding my knowledge in finance, statistics, and programming for quant applications, and I’m also planning to pursue a master’s degree to strengthen my foundation and gain international exposure.

I view this journey not as a detour but as a conscious investment in becoming a more capable, curious, and complete version of myself.

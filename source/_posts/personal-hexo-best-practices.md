The following is the definition given by official websites.

> Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (or other markup languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds.

Compared to other static site generators, such as Hugo or Jekyll, Hexo strikes a balance between speed and simplicity. Compared to traditional CMS platforms like **WordPress**, Hexo can be free when deployed on GitHub and is convenient to maintain.

Here are some personal Hexo best practices aimed at building an aesthetic and handy pattern in a short time. It will take you hours to clone an identically good-looking site, and you can keep blogging continuously.

## Install

There is no problem with following the [official install guide](https://hexo.io/docs/#Installation) step by step since Hexo is such a simple software.

## Deploy

It is better to use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to deploy GitHub Pages, which works in both public and private repositories, than using a one-command deployment unless you donâ€™t want your source code seen by the public, because it is more modern and conforms to the conventional project development model with less reliance on the local environment.

As a former, follow the [official deployment guide](https://hexo.io/docs/github-pages). But here is a tip you should follow: you can directly choose a suitable repository name instead of following the format of `username.github.io`, for the reason that the former one will generate a more readable URL like `https://ian-tsien.github.io/404BlogNotFound/` than `https://ian-tsien.github.io/ian-tsien.github.io/`.
